# Java Client Benchmarks — Full Details

Detailed performance comparison of Java client libraries running on GitHub Actions runners. Results are automatically updated via CI.

> **Note**: These benchmarks run on shared GitHub Actions runners. Results may have variance between runs due to noisy neighbor effects. The graphs show averages across multiple runs (n=count shown in labels).

## Workload Configuration

All benchmarks use the same reference workload:
- **1M requests** per phase (STEADY)
- **1M keys** with 16-byte keys, `bench:` prefix
- **512 bytes** data size for SET operations
- **50/50 GET/SET** command mix (uniform random)
- **No rate limiting** (max throughput)
