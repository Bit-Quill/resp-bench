"""Async benchmark engine.

Concurrency model: a single asyncio event loop with **one client per
connection** and **one worker coroutine per connection**, run concurrently.
Each worker awaits one command at a time -- i.e. ``pipeline_depth`` is
effectively 1, the same "one in-flight request per connection" shape the Java
engine's virtual-thread workers produce.

A request-based phase target is a single budget shared across all workers, which
they claim from one request at a time -- matching the Java reference's shared
``AtomicLong`` rather than pre-splitting the target per worker.

Known limits of this model, both deliberate:

* **Single event loop.** Above roughly ``HIGH_CONNECTION_WARN_THRESHOLD``
  connections the loop itself, not the driver, becomes the bottleneck, and the
  loop's queuing delay is attributed to the driver in the reported latency. The
  Java engine faced the same ceiling with a single command-issuing thread (see
  ``docs/ARCHITECTURE.md``) and solved it with multiple issuer threads; this
  engine has no equivalent yet, so it warns above the threshold. Do not compare
  high-connection-count Python results against other engines without accounting
  for this.
* **``pipeline_depth > 1``** (multiple in-flight requests per connection) is not
  implemented; a phase requesting it runs at depth 1 with a warning.
